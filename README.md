# day_planner
bootcamp.day.planner.homework
This Day Planner was part of my Bootcamp Homework.
It is designed to create/save and delete a weekly schedule which keeps track of Date/Time.
This project was possible thanks to my Instructors, TAs, classmates, Tutors and Docs/Examples found from various sourses across google.com

As i am in the learning stages of my coding journey any/all critique, advise and comments are highly appreciated.
Please give it a try and i hope you enjoy it.
